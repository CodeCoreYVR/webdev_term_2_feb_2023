[Lab] Todo List New and Create

1. Build a simple todo list with Express that has one index page build on the project from the previous lab.
2. Create two routes:
  a. GET /tasks which should act as an index and the form for creating the tasks should be at the top of the tasks list.
  b. POST /tasks which should create a task when the form from GET /tasks is submitted, then redirects back to GET /tasks
3. You will need to create a new table, tasks, for your project.
  a. It will have a table, tasks, which will have timestamps columns, an incrementing id column and a body column.

[Lab] Todo List CRUD operations

1. Separate the routes related to /tasks to it's own module and the rest of the routes in a root router.
2. Complete the rest of the CRUD operations on tasks with REST conventions:
  a. A route to show a single note at GET /tasks/:id
  b. A route to delete a note at DELETE /tasks/:id
  c. A route to edit a note at GET /tasks/:id/:edit
  d. A route to update an edited note at PATCH /tasks/:id
