[Lab] Car Status

Build a web application with Express.js.
1. Install morgan middleware to log HTTP requests and install ejs view templates.
2. Install nodemon saving it as a dev dependency using --save-dev. Then in the package.json update your start script to use nodemon instead of node.
3. Create a page for /car_status that has a form for users to enter the year of their car.
4. After submitting the form, show on top of the page "future", "new", "old" or "very old" based on the year entered from the user.
Stretch
1. Use a drop down list that is auto-populated with years from 2025 down to 1950.


[Lab] FizzBuzz... Again?

1. Create a new page at the path /fizz_buzz in your Express application.
2. Display a form that will take two inputs: number1 and number2.
3. Then, it will show the numbers from 1 to 100 replacing the numbers that are below the form: - Divisible by number1 with "Fizz" - And, the numbers that are divisible by number2 with "Buzz" - And, the numbers that are divisible by number1 and number2 with "FizzBuzz".
4. number1 and number2 should be given as a query string.
