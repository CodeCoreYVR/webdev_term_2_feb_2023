[Lab] Dictionary

Given this dictionary file: https://s3.amazonaws.com/codecore-website-data/certifiedin_images/Oxford+English+Dictionary.txt

Use Node.js HTTP server to build a simple dictionary web app. The website should work as follows:
1. If you go to the home page such as http://localhost:5000 it will display "Welcome to Dictionary".
2. If you go to a URL like http://localhost:5000/?word=Abandon where the word is defined in the dictionary it will display the definition of the word `Abandon`.
3. If you go to a URL like http://localhost:5000/?word=fdsdfddf where the word is not defined in the dictionary it will display `Sorry your word was not found`.
