[Lab] Largest number in a list

Write a TCP client and a server application in Node.js:
- The client should take a string input of comma delimited numbers from the user (e.g. "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9") and send it to the server.
- The server should respond with the largest number. (e.g. given "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9" responds with 9)
- The client should print the server response in the console.


------------------- To Run -------------------
- Open terminal window
$ node server.js
- Open second terminal window
$ node client.js
