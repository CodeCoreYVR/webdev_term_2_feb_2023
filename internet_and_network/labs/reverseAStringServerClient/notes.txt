[Lab] Reverse a string server / client

Write a TCP client and a server application in Node.js:
- The client should take a string input from the user (e.g. "hello", "what is this?") and send it to the server.
- The server should respond to the client with the reversed word. (e.g. "hello" becomes "olleh", "what is this?" becomes "?siht si tahw")
- The client should print the server response in the console.

------------------- To Run -------------------
- Open terminal window
$ node server.js
- Open second terminal window
$ node client.js
