 - Edit the 20230301000000_create_countries_table.js file to define the countries table with the required columns
 
$ knex migrate:make create_populations_table
 - This will generate a new migration file named 20230301000001_create_populations_table.js (the timestamp will vary based on the current date and time) in the migrations directory of your project.
 - Edit the 20230301000001_create_populations_table.js file to define the populations table with the required columns

 - This will run all pending migrations in your migrations directory and create the countries and populations tables in your database.
 
$ psql knex_labs_db
 # \d countries
 # \d populations

$ knex seed:latest
  - seeds your database with desired data from countriesData.js

$ psql knex_labs_db
  # SELECT * FROM countries:
  or
  # SELECT id, name, code FROM countries;
  - Is your database seeded with desired data?
