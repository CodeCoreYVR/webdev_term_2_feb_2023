* Install `letter-opener` gem in development and test group
```
gem 'letter_opener', '~> 1.4', '>= 1.4.1'
```

* Rails comes with ActionMailer that enables us to send mails from the application with controllers and view.
Check https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html for more information. 

* Create a file `/config/initializers/setup_mail.rb`. The setting format comes from ActionMailer gem.
```ruby
ActionMailer::Base.smtp_settings = {
    address:              "smtp.gmail.com",
    port:                 "587",
    enable_starttls_auto: true,
    authentication:       :plain,
    user_name:            ENV["email_user_name"],
    password:             ENV["email_password"]
  }
```

* Create a file `/config/initializers/app_keys.rb` for the environment variables, and add it to .gitignore
```ruby
#app_keys.rb
ENV["email_user_name"] = "yourusername"
ENV["email_password"]  = "supersecret"
```
```
#.gitignore
/**/config/initializers/app_keys.rb
```

* Create an sample file `/config/initializers/app_keys.rb.example` to save the environment variable names so that other app_keys.rb files can be created easily when deploying in production or test environment.


* Run the following command to generate a mailer for answer. We want to send email to the questioner when someone answers the question.
```
rails g mailer answers_mailer
```
After running the command a directory `app/mailer` will be created where the controller and view remains for sending email.

* Created files:
```
create  app/mailers/answers_mailer.rb
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/answers_mailer
      invoke  rspec
      create    spec/mailers/answers_mailer_spec.rb
      create    spec/mailers/previews/answers_mailer_preview.rb
```

* HTML vs Text in email. Check https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/21367/plain-text-email-support-is-it-still-needed-in-2011

* Define Email method
```ruby
class AnswersMailer < ApplicationMailer

  def notify_questioner(answer)
    @answer   = answer
    @question = answer.question
    @owner    = @question.user
    mail(to: @owner.email, subject: "You got a new answer!")
  end

end
```

* Add the following line in `config/environments/development.rb` so that the email saved to temp directory instead of sending for development environment.
```ruby
    config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :letter_opener
    config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
```

* The default mailing url needs to be added in `config/environments/development.rb`. For production it will be different. In production, consider using a dedicated mailing service instead of google.
```ruby
  config.action_mailer.default_url_options = {host: 'localhost', port: 3000}
```

* Call the method from answers_controller#create to send the email after saving the anser in db.
```ruby
#answers_controller.rb
#... after save in create action
AnswersMailer.notify_questioner(@answer).deliver_now 
#...
```

* Answer a question and the content of sent email  will be saved in `/tmp/letter_opener/`

* We can also use `AnswersMailer.notify_questioner(@answer).deliver_later` to send the email in the background jobs. We need to set up `ActiveJob` with background processing system such as `delayedJob`.
